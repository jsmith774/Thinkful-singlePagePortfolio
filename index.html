          <h2>Intro:</h2>
          <!--Who you are-->
          <p>I am Jim Smith and I'm pleased to meet you. I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer.  I've always been eager to learn and love a challenge. </p>
          
          <!--Where you are-->
          <p>I reside in the central Ohio area, but have a home office and welcome remote work opportunities. I am also totally open to travel or relocating temporarily for short-term gigs or contract projects less than 18-24 months as long as I can get back home every couple of weekends.</p>

          <!--What you do an what makes you special -->
          <p>While I'm new to front end work and just getting started with JavaScript and CSS, I'm an experienced software developer.  I began my early career as a COBOL programmer, the moved into server-side Java and OOP.  Most of my career spent working with enterprise Java focused on middle-tier and backend work.  I left the industry in 2012 to pursue other opportunities, but genuinely missed coding and decided to get back into web/software development.  The tools and technologies and best practices had changed considerably in that time, and even in the enterprise Java eco-system, the multitude of new features in and upgrades in the core libraries and the nearly ubiquitous frameworks meant I had some learning to do.  Since I needed to knock the rust off and retool anyway, I thought I'd begin the journey with some front-end/full-stack web development using modern technologies.</p>

          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          
          <!-- demonstrate your passion for the web -->
          <p>I've loved technology for as long as I can remember.  From my first experience playing "Oregon Trail" in school, to a curiosity about how my movements on a joystick could control Pac-Man on an Atari 2600.  I taught myself BASIC when I was 12 years old and made very basic text-based "choose your own adventure" style games.  The internet and the web were even more exciting - accessing documents from university libraries on the other side of the country and even the other side of the world.  I've always focused more on the backend and still have an interest in that side of the work, but I also want to get some frontend experience as well.</p>
          
          <!-- demonstrate desire to work on a team with great programmers -->
          <p>I work well independently, but real-world projects require great teams.  The strength of a team comes not just from increased bodies working on a project, but the internal interactions that can happen.  Appropriate delegation to those best suited to a task when time is of the essence, and more importantly, skill development and growth opportunities in areas where a team member may be weak or inexperienced when the timeline allows.  A great team should succeed individually and collectively.  Recognize and call out successes. However when a team fails, without regard to what may or may not have happened behind the scenes, there is a public-facing unity, and the failure is the fault of the entire team.</p>

          <!-- show your personality outside of coding -->
          <p>I love solving problems and figuring out the unique problems when they arise.  Outside of coding, I enjoy medieval fantasy novels/movies, playing video games, cooking, and taste-testing high-end spirits.  I find that combining these hobbies often makes each more enjoyable.</p>

          <!-- List of services you can (or want to) provide a client. -->
          <p>I offer a variety of services and am available for full or part-time employment or corp-to-corp independent contractor gigs.  I'm familiar with a variety of technologies and well versed at self-teaching from technical manuals and other resources as needed and am happy to research new tools/technologies for a project on my own time.</p>

          <h2>Projects:</h2>
          <p>Most of my prior projects are proprietary corporate-owned code so I don't have any historic examples.  I'll add to this project list as I build things for my own experience or as assigned as part of any formal training program.</p>
